              <p>
                My web design process encompasses wireframing, creating initial
                sketches with Figma or Adobe XD, and refining multiple
                prototypes to reach the final design. I focus on crafting
                modern, responsive, and accessible websites that offer excellent
                performance.

                <p>
                  Cisco HIG is a web application that helps customers onboard
                  network devices such as switches, routers, and WAP's. The web
                  app is built with SvelteKit. The premise of the app is to get
                  support articles and technical documentation to the user. We
                  leverage a FastAPI server and MongoDB to regularly update the
                  content data and developed user-friendly interfaces for
                  consuming the support articles and technical documentation.
                  For a future release, we have already developed a feature
                  using LangChain that provides additional support, Q/A, and
                  guidance through each step of the installation process. There
                  are other HIG's that exist out there, such as for the Catalyst
                  1200 and CBS110 Series Switches. This was a design decision
                  above my head.

                  Typeorm-Fastify-Plugin is a small and lightweight plugin for
                  use within the Fastify Community. Fastify.io is a fast and low
                  overhead web framework for Node.js that heavily depends on
                  it's community of plugins. The plugin enables developers to
                  create and namespace multiple Database Connections using
                  Typeorm API and exposes those connections to the Fastify
                  Server, available app-wide. The plugin is written in
                  TypeScript, tests are ran with TapJS, and workflows are
                  automated through Travis-CI and GitHub Actions.

                <p>
                  The idea behind "MealSteal" (not a great name, I admitðŸ˜‹) is
                  to be a food delivery web application. Built entirely with
                  React and styled-components, this app highlights the benefits
                  of state and context, which enabled me to create a shopping
                  cart. The data is stored and fetched from Firebase RTDB.
                  Additionally, this application takes advantage of the
                  React-Transition-Group to render animations.

                <p>
                  MyMapty is one of the first projects I ever built utilizing
                  JavaScript ES6 classes, HTML & CSS. MyMapty gets the end-user
                  location via the Geolocation API and passes these coordinates
                  to the Leaflet library, rendering a beautiful map layer. The
                  user can then map their workouts by interacting with the map
                  and inputting their custom workout data. Workouts are then
                  stored in local storage so they can be accessed across browser
                  refreshes. Users can choose between running and cycling but I
                  plan on adding more options.

                <p>
                  The inspiration to create CAB Coffee Shop came about during my
                  time at Penn State University. The project is a collaboration
                  between myself and 2 other classmates. The name, CAB, actually
                  comes from the initials of our last names. The project is
                  built with Webpack on the front-end, complete with minifiers,
                  code splitting and much more. Our team is proud that we built
                  a shopping cart view that maintains its state across browser
                  refreshes using vanilla JavaScript.
